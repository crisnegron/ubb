    \section{Review}

    Find the average rate of change for each function between the given values of the variable (Section 2.3).

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item $f(x) = x^3 - 2x$; $x = -1$, $x = 3$
        \begin{solution}
          \begin{align*}
            f_{avg} &= \frac{3^3 - 2 \cdot 3 - \left( (-1)^3 - 2(-1) \right)}{3 - (-1)} \\
                    % &= \frac{27 - 6 - \left( -1 + 2 \right)}{4} \\
                    % &= \frac{21 - \left( 1 \right)}{4} \\
                    &= 5 \\
          \end{align*}
        \end{solution}

      \item $f(x) = \frac{2}{x + 1}$; $x = a$, $x = a + h$
        \begin{solution}
          \begin{align*}
            f_{avg} &= \cfrac{\cfrac{2}{a + h + 1} - \cfrac{2}{a + 1}}{a + h - a} \\
                    &= \frac{2a + 2 - (2a + 2h + 2)}{h(a + h + 1)(a + 1)} \\
                    &= \frac{2h}{h(a + h + 1)(a + 1)} \\
                    &= \frac{2}{(a + h + 1)(a + 1)} \\
          \end{align*}
        \end{solution}

        \ldots most legislators, politicians, lawyers, ministers, and office-holders serve the state chiefly with their
        heads; and, as they rarely make any moral distinctions, they are as likely to serve the devil, without intending
        it, as God. A very few, as heroes, patriots, martyrs, reformers in the great sense, and men, serve the state with
        their consciences also, and so necessarily resist it for the most part; and they are commonly treated as enemies
        by it.

        % The political policies that are called conservative these days would appall any genuine conservative, if there
        % were one around to be appalled. For example, the central policy of the Reagan Administration---which was
        % supposed to be conservative---was to build up a powerful state. The state grew in power more under Reagan than
        % in any peacetime period, even if you just measure it by state expenditures. The state intervention in the
        % economy vastly increased. That's what the Pentagon system is, in fact; it's the creation of a state-guaranteed
        % market and subsidy system for high-technology production.

        % The ``corporatization of America'' during the past century has been an attack on democracyâ€”and on markets,
        % part of the shift from something resembling "capitalism" to the highly administered markets of the modern
        % state/corporate era. A current variant is called "minimizing the state," that is, transferring decision-making
        % power from the public arena to somewhere else: "to the people" in the rhetoric of power; to private tyrannies,
        % in the real world.
