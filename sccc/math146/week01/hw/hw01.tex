        The data show the percentage of each age group that bought music.  A pie chart might show what percentage of
        the total online music market went to each age group, which is a completely different set of numbers.

          \part Ignoring the outliers, the shape looks symmetric.

          \part The center seems to be around 2\%.

          \part The smallest return was around -12\% and the largest return was around 14\%.

          \part About a third of the months had a return less than zero.

        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Graph b and graph c both have two choices.  The number of females/males is probably more even than the
            number of left handed/right handed, so graph c is the female/male graph.

          \item graph b

          \item Graph d is evenly distributed around some average number, so this is probably the height.

          \item Graph a shows a bunch of people who don't study at all, with gradually diminishing numbers of people who
            study more hours per night.

          \part All the fish oils have ratios greater than or equal to 2 which makes them pretty healthy.

          \part Since the states have varying numbers of people, it's more interesting to know the ratio of doctors to
          people than the total number of doctors.

            \end{figure}

            The histogram is right-skewed with a center around 230.  Washington DC is an outlier, probably because
            it is a city and not a state.

        The histogram is left-skewed with a center around 1000. and a spread of 3000, ignoring the one outlier.  1987
        was an outlier.

            It looks like the pot smokers tend to get in more car accidents.

      \item[41]
        Most coins you would find would probably have been made in the last decade.  However, coins have a long life, so
        you might find a few coins which are 40 or 50 years old.

      \item[44]
        \begin{parts}
          \part In each year, the prices are highest around July and lowest around January.

            The center is around 13.  About half the years had less than 13 attacks and about half the years had 13 or more
            attacks.
