  \section{Overview}
  This course will cover parts I and II of {\em The Basic Practice}, by David Moore.  

  This course assumes that you are familiar with basic math concepts like fractions and percentages.  No other math is
  required.

  \section{Homework and Exams}

  You should expect to spend three or four hours each week doing homework.  Feel free to work together with other students
  on the homework.

  Each chapter will be followed by an in-class test.  

  \section{Credit}
  Unfortunately we don't have a way to get college credit for this course today.  We're working with Seattle Central to
  provide some way for students to test out of math 146 in the future, but can't promise anything.
