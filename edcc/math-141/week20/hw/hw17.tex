      \begin{em}
        \ldots most legislators, politicians, lawyers, ministers, and office-holders, serve the state chiefly with their
        heads; and, as they rarely make any moral distinctions, they are as likely to serve the devil, without intending
        it, as God. A very few, as heroes, patriots, martyrs, reformers in the great sense, and men, serve the state with
        their consciences also, and so necessarily resist it for the most part; and they are commonly treated as enemies
        by it.

        % The political policies that are called conservative these days would appall any genuine conservative, if there
        % were one around to be appalled. For example, the central policy of the Reagan Administration---which was
        % supposed to be conservative---was to build up a powerful state. The state grew in power more under Reagan than
        % in any peacetime period, even if you just measure it by state expenditures. The state intervention in the
        % economy vastly increased. That's what the Pentagon system is, in fact; it's the creation of a state-guaranteed
        % market and subsidy system for high-technology production.

        % The ``corporatization of America'' during the past century has been an attack on democracyâ€”and on markets,
        % part of the shift from something resembling "capitalism" to the highly administered markets of the modern
        % state/corporate era. A current variant is called "minimizing the state," that is, transferring decision-making
        % power from the public arena to somewhere else: "to the people" in the rhetoric of power; to private tyrannies,
        % in the real world.
