                      Relativity

    In 1905 when he was a 25-year old clerk at the patent office, Albert Einstein
discovered the theory of Special Relativity in his spare time.

Einstein proposed two simple rules:
   o as long as you travel in a straight line, the laws physics are the same,
     regardless of how fast you are moving
   o the speed of light in a vacuum is one of the laws of physics

He applied a little algebra and a lot of imagination and discovered that if
you follow these two rules carefully, there are some very interesting 
consequences:
   o time travels more slowly for fast-moving objects
   o fast moving objects shrink
   o energy and mass are really two aspects of the same thing (E = mc^2)

Why should you care? Relativity brings us:
   o nuclear power
   o the atom bomb
   o the Global Position System (GPS)
   o black holes

No math is required, although a little knowledge of algebra will be helpful
at a few points.
