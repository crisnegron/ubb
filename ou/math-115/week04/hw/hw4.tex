\title{Math 115 Homework 4}
\date{October 26, 2010}

\begin{document}

\maketitle
 
If, after the algebra final, you feel like you'd rather bang your head on the wall than do more math, feel free to take a
well-deserved week off.  However, if you feel like experimenting with a calculator, you can borrow one of the UBB
graphing calculators and try these problems.

\begin{itemize}
\item p. 30: 3, 5, 10 (or any of the other problems on page 30)

\item 
The number of lumens (amount of light) $L$ from a fluorescent lamp can be approximated by:

\[
  L(w) = -0.249w^2 + 97.744w - 664.875
\]

where $20 \leq w \leq 90$ and $w$ is the wattage of the lamp.  Use a graphing calculator to graph the function and
estimate the wattage necessary to obtain 2,000 lumens

\end{itemize}
