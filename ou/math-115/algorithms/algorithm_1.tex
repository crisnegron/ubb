\title{Algorithm Question}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

A cable television company wants to determine how much bandwidth will be required to deliver the television signal on a
particular day.  Of course, during the day there are numerous shows at various channels and times.  Each show may have a 
different bandwidth requirement.

The relevant information for each show is:
\begin{itemize*}
\item channel number
\item start time
\item duration
\item bandwidth requirement (positive integer)
\end{itemize*}

Find an algorithm which finds the maximum bandwidth required for a collection of shows.

\vspace{.5 cm}

For example, given the following schedule:
\begin{itemize*}
\item 9:00-10:00, channel 1, bandwidth 5
\item 9:30-10:30, channel 2, bandwidth 7
\item 10:15-10:45, channel 3, bandwidth 10
\end{itemize*}

the bandwidth requirement of 17 occurs between 10:15 and 10:30.
