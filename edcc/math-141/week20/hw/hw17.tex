        The political policies that are called conservative these days would appall any genuine conservative, if there
        were one around to be appalled. For example, the central policy of the Reagan Administration---which was
        supposed to be conservative---was to build up a powerful state. The state grew in power more under Reagan than
        in any peacetime period, even if you just measure it by state expenditures. The state intervention in the
        economy vastly increased. That's what the Pentagon system is, in fact; it's the creation of a state-guaranteed
        market and subsidy system for high-technology production.

        % The ``corporatization of America'' during the past century has been an attack on democracyâ€”and on markets,
        % part of the shift from something resembling "capitalism" to the highly administered markets of the modern
        % state/corporate era. A current variant is called "minimizing the state," that is, transferring decision-making
        % power from the public arena to somewhere else: "to the people" in the rhetoric of power; to private tyrannies,
        % in the real world.
