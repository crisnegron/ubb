      \item[26] 95\% of the people will be within two standard deviations of the mean.  

        mildly obese:
        \begin{align*}
          x_{min} &= 373 - 67 * 2 = 239 \\
          x_{max} &= 373 + 67 * 2 = 507 \\
        \end{align*}

        95\% of the mildly obese people will have between 239 and 507 minutes of activity per day.

        lean:
        \begin{align*}
          x_{min} &= 526 - 107 * 2 = 312 \\
          x_{min} &= 526 + 107 * 2 = 740 \\
        \end{align*}

        95\% of the lean people will have between 312 and 740 minutes of activity per day.

      \item[27]
        70 is two standard deviations below the mean.  Since 5\% of the people are more than two standard deviations
        from the mean and half of these are on the bottom end of the range, about 2.5\% will qualify.

        Even voting for the right is doing nothing for it. It is only expressing to men feebly your desire that it
        should prevail. 
        % A wise man will not leave the right to the mercy of chance, nor wish it to prevail through the power of the
        % majority. There is but little virtue in the action of masses of men. When the majority shall at length vote for
        % the abolition of slavery, it will be because they are indifferent to slavery, or because there is but little
        % slavery left to be abolished by their vote.
