\question
Two ferryboats start at the same instant from opposite sides of a river, traveling across the water on routes at right
angles to the shores.  Each travels at a constant speed, but one is faster than the other.  They pass at a point 720
yards from the nearest shore.  Both boats remain in their slips for 10 minutes before starting back.  On the return
trips, they meet 400 yards from the other shore.

How wide is the river?
