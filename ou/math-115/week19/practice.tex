\item

The frog population in a small pond grows exponentially.  The current population is 85 frogs, and the relative growth rate is 18\% per year.

\begin{description}
\item[a]
Find a function that models the population after $t$ years.

\item[b]
Find the projected population after 3 years.

\item[c]
Find the number of years for the frog population to reach 600.

\item
The half-life of cesium-137 is 30 years.  Suppose we have a 10-g sample.

\begin{description}
\item[a]
Find a function that models the mass remaining after $t$ years.

\item[b]
How much of the sample will remain after 80 years.

\item[c]
After how long will only 2g of the sample remain?

\item
The burial cloth of an Egyptian mummy is estimated to contain 59\% of the carbon-14 it contained originally.  How long
ago was the mummy buried?  The half-life of carbon-14 is 5,730 years.
