This problem uses the following two formulas:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  V & = & \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \\
  A & = & 4 \pi r^2 \\
\end{eqnarray*}
Where {\em V} is the volume of a sphere and {\em A} is the surface area of a sphere.

In H.G. Well's novel, {\em The First Men in the Moon}, the moon is found to be hinabited by intelligent
insect creatures who live in caves below the surface.  These creatures, let us assume, have a unit of distance that we
shall call a ``lunar.''  It was adopted because the moon's surface area, if expressed in square lunars, exactly equals
the moon's volume in cubic lunars.  The moon's radius is 1,080 miles.  How many miles long is a lunar?
