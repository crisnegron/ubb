      \item[25] The larger number is the mean because the mean is dragged upward by a few people who make hundreds of
        thousands of dollars.

      \item[26] For the people who are still working (21-64), there are a lot of young people with almost no retirement
        money and a few older people with large retirement accounts.  This makes the distribution right-skewed and the
        mean is larger than the median.

        For the people who are mostly retired (55 or older), almost everyone has some retirement money saved, and there
        are only a few people with no retirement money.  This makes the distribution left-skewed and the mean is smaller
        than the median.

      \item[27] 
        \begin{itemize*}
          \item the median is college 393
          \item the first quartile is college 197
          \item the third quartile is college 590
        \end{itemize*}

        The summary doesn't show the shape that the histogram does.

      \item[30]
        If you add up all the bars, you find that there are 78 girls.  The median would be between girl number 39 and
        40, which would be in the 2 servings bar.  The first quartile would be girl 19 which is in the 1 serving bar and
        the third quartile would be girl 59 which is in the 4 servings bar.  So the answer is:

        \begin{itemize*}
          \item first quartile: 1
          \item median: 2
          \item third quartile: 4
        \end{itemize*}
        
      \item[32]
        \begin{parts}
          \part symmetric distributions without outliers

          \part 
            \begin{itemize*}
              \item for the men, $\bar{x}$ went from 117.17 to 110.86 and $s$ went from 74.24 to 66.88
              \item for the women, $\bar{x}$ went from 165.17 to 158.45 and $s$ went from 56.51 to 43.65
            \end{itemize*}

        Even voting for the right is doing nothing for it. It is only expressing to men feebly your desire that it
        should prevail. 
        % A wise man will not leave the right to the mercy of chance, nor wish it to prevail through the power of the
        % majority. There is but little virtue in the action of masses of men. When the majority shall at length vote for
        % the abolition of slavery, it will be because they are indifferent to slavery, or because there is but little
        % slavery left to be abolished by their vote.
